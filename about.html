      <h1>About Todd &amp; Gary</h1>
      <p>
        Meet Todd and Gary—two Australian buskers who found their calling on the streets of Berlin. 
        For over a decade, they’ve been beating out bold rhythms on everyday buckets, transforming 
        simple plastic pails into powerful instruments of creativity, connection, and personal growth.
      </p>

      <h2>From Struggle to Stage</h2>
      <p>
        Life in a new city wasn’t always smooth sailing. Todd and Gary initially struggled to make ends meet, 
        but they soon discovered the amazing potential of bucket drumming. What started as a way to earn 
        spare change quickly blossomed into a vibrant street act that not only paid the bills, but ignited 
        their self-confidence and sense of purpose. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Their daily performances became a source of pride and momentum—fueling a passion that carried them 
        from small street corners to grand festival stages. They learned that sometimes the simplest passions 
        or ideas can lead to extraordinary growth when pursued wholeheartedly.
      </p>

      <h2>Finding Passion in Simplicity</h2>
      <p>
        Todd and Gary believe that you don’t need expensive gear or formal training to spark creativity. 
        By transforming everyday objects (like buckets) into percussion instruments, they tapped into an 
        entire world of music and inspiration—one rooted in discipline, grit, and an entrepreneurial spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their story proves that with the right mindset, even a humble plastic bucket can become a platform 
        for artistic expression and personal development.
      </p>

      <h2>The Road to Workshops</h2>
      <p>
        After years of energizing passersby in Berlin’s bustling squares, Todd and Gary realized their 
        busking lessons extended far beyond music. They’d developed a knack for capturing attention, 
        fostering teamwork, and boosting confidence—skills that resonate strongly in the corporate and 
        professional world. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, they lead <strong>Bucket Drumming Workshops</strong> that help businesses, nonprofits, and 
        community groups discover the transformative power of rhythm and creativity. Their sessions highlight:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Team Bonding &amp; Unity:</strong> Encouraging colleagues to synchronize beats fosters trust and teamwork.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication &amp; Confidence:</strong> Using rhythm and body language to speak volumes, even before words.</li>
        <li><strong>Overcoming Challenges:</strong> Stepping out of your comfort zone, celebrating small wins, and building momentum.</li>
      </ul>
