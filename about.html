      <h1>About Todd &amp; Gary</h1>
      <p>
        Meet Todd (from Adelaide) and Gary (from Sydney)—two Australian drummers who followed their passion 
        all the way to Berlin. They first crossed paths by chance on a bustling Berlin street, each with little more 
        than a few buckets and an unbreakable love for rhythm. A spontaneous jam session soon revealed they shared 
        not only musical chemistry, but a common dream: to bring people together through simple, powerful beats.
      </p>

      <h2>From Street Corners to Corporate Workshops</h2>
      <p>
        When they began busking, Todd and Gary discovered that bucket drumming was more than street entertainment—it 
        was a way to captivate crowds, build confidence, and communicate without words. Over time, they realized these 
        same principles of <strong>trust, teamwork, and creativity</strong> could transform corporate and community 
        environments as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Bucket Drumming?</h2>
      <p>
        Bucket drumming is fun, accessible, and surprisingly impactful. Todd and Gary believe that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anyone can join in:</strong> No fancy equipment or training needed—just an open mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Rhythm unites teams:</strong> Synchronizing beats builds trust, harmony, and collaboration.</li>
        <li><strong>Confidence grows with practice:</strong> Overcoming stage fright and self-doubt leads to real personal and professional growth.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Whether performing in front of a café or running a high-energy workshop, Todd and Gary see each bucket 
        as a canvas for creativity, and every performance as a chance to inspire.
      </p>
