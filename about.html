      <h1>About Todd &amp; Gary</h1>
      <p>
        Meet Todd (from Adelaide) and Gary (from Sydney)—two Australian drummers who followed their passion 
        all the way to Berlin. Each has a strong foundation in music and performance, having studied at universities 
        in Australia where they honed not just their technique, but also their collaborative skills through 
        band leadership and teaching. Their shared vision? To use rhythm as a universal language for bringing 
        people together.
      </p>

      <h2>From Street Corners to Corporate Workshops</h2>
      <p>
        Their journey began on a lively Berlin street, each armed with only a few buckets and 
        an unwavering love for percussion. A spontaneous jam session revealed a powerful synergy—not just 
        in their drumming, but also in their desire to inspire. Over time, they discovered that the same 
        principles powering their busking success—<strong>trust, teamwork, creativity, and the courage to be heard</strong>—could 
        transform corporate environments, community groups, and beyond.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Bucket Drumming?</h2>
      <p>
        Bucket drumming is fun, accessible, and unexpectedly impactful. For Todd and Gary, it’s the perfect 
        medium to help participants:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Embrace inclusivity:</strong> No fancy instruments or prior musical experience required—just 
          an open mind and willingness to collaborate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Synchronize and communicate:</strong> Keeping a unified beat encourages active listening, trust, 
          and clear communication, key elements for any thriving team.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build self-confidence and face fears:</strong> Overcoming stage fright or performance anxiety 
          leads to real personal and professional growth.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Whether performing on a street corner or leading an energetic workshop, Todd and Gary see each bucket 
        as a canvas for creativity, and each performance as a chance to ignite enthusiasm, connection, and 
        meaningful interaction.
      </p>

      <h2>The Heart of Their Workshops</h2>
      <p>
        Today, Todd and Gary channel their passion for performance and education into 
        <strong>Bucket Drumming Workshops</strong> that unlock creativity, team spirit, and personal breakthroughs. 
        As remote work environments become more common, they believe it’s more crucial than ever to provide 
        hands-on experiences where colleagues can reconnect, rediscover a sense of community, and 
        celebrate shared accomplishments.
      </p>
      <p>After a session with Todd and Gary, participants often leave with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Energized motivation</strong> for everyday work and challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased self-confidence</strong> from stepping outside their comfort zone.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhanced communication skills</strong>—essential for staying connected and aligned 
          in modern hybrid or remote team settings.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stronger bonds</strong> with fellow drummers, colleagues, or friends, built on a steady collective beat.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Join Todd and Gary on this rhythmic journey and see how the power of a few buckets can revitalize 
        your team, spark innovation, and help everyone drum up the confidence they need to thrive—both 
        on stage and in the workplace.
